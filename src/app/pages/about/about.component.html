    <h2 class="about-subtitle">overview</h2>
    <p class="about-p">
      As with every business, we must stay up to dateÂ with the times and
      technology, which led to the development of an application whose main aim
      is to check out clients. This application will let our technicians service
      our customers while collecting data on how frequently services are
      performed. Users can create a profile to log in, check out a customer and
      create an invoice. Users can also customize their security questions and
      answers for each profile, making password resets quick and straightforward
      if necessary. The administrator job will have access to data reports that
      show how many services have been billed at the moment.
